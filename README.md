Unusual Findings: 

1.) Tableau sheet/story/dashboard: AgeStory, AgeDashboard, sheets focused on Age ----

Total ridership below 30 is surprisingly low. As the sheets focused on ridership by age, the AgeStory and the AgeDashboard show, total number of riders below 30 are only about 15% of total ridership. The main hypothesis that I believe supports this phenomena is:  Given that younger populations may be less wealthy, their location of residence is likely too far away from city center to support bike riding, and will likely require forms of transportation that support longer commutes, such as public transportation (train, bus, etc.) or transport by car. 

2.) Tableau sheet: TripDurByAge ----

The age group with the second and third longest trip durations per ride on average is the 50-59 year old group, and the 60-69 year old group, respectively. This is partly surprising given the physical toll of bicycling, and the expectation that it might have been the younger populations who are able to make longer trips. However, this data may not indicate length of trip, and may only suggest that these populations take longer to arrive to their desination.
